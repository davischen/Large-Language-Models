# Introduction to Project Components

This repository consists of four major components, each focusing on specific natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning tasks. Below is an introduction to each component:

---

## 1. **Fact-Checking_Analysis**

### **Overview**
This component focuses on building fact-checking systems to validate the accuracy of claims against a corpus of evidence, such as Wikipedia passages. It utilizes various approaches including entailment models and overlap-based heuristics.

### **Key Features**
- Preprocessing textual data by cleaning and tokenizing.
- Implementing multiple fact-checking strategies:
  - Word overlap-based recall.
  - Pre-trained entailment models (e.g., DeBERTa).
  - Random guessing as a baseline.
- Scoring predictions for factual claims based on supported or not supported labels.

### **Use Cases**
- Automating the verification of statements against a trusted corpus.
- Supporting misinformation detection.

## 2. **Sentiment_Analysis_with_Deep_Learning**

### **Overview**
This component implements sentiment analysis using deep learning models such as Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs). It leverages pre-trained word embeddings to classify text as positive or negative.

### **Key Features**
- Feature extraction using unigram and bigram methods.
- Neural network-based classifiers for binary sentiment classification.
- Pre-trained word embeddings for richer text representation.

### **Use Cases**
- Analyzing customer feedback to determine satisfaction levels.
- Identifying sentiment trends in social media or product reviews.

## 3. **Transformer-Based_Language_Modeling**

### **Overview**
This component provides an implementation of a custom Transformer-based model designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks such as character-level language modeling and text generation.

### **Key Features**
- Custom Transformer architecture with positional encoding.
- Self-attention and feedforward layers for learning complex dependencies.
- Token-level predictions and attention visualization.

### **Use Cases**
- Generating text based on character-level sequences.
- Modeling language patterns for tasks like auto-completion or predictive typing.

## 4. **sentiment_analysis**

### **Overview**
This component contains classical machine learning models for sentiment analysis. It provides simpler alternatives to deep learning methods while supporting feature engineering techniques.

### **Key Features**
- Bag-of-words and n-gram feature extraction.
- Classifiers including logistic regression and perceptron.
- Focus on interpretability and feature importance.

### **Use Cases**
- Quick and interpretable sentiment analysis for smaller datasets.
- Benchmarking classical methods against deep learning models.
