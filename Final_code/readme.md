# Overview of Analysis and Augmentation Notebooks

This section provides an introduction to five Jupyter notebooks included in the repository, each designed to assist in analyzing error types, augmenting data, training, and testing NLP models systematically.

## **Notebook Descriptions**

### 1. **`0.Run_final_errortype_analysis.ipynb`**
#### **Purpose:**
Focuses on analyzing error types in model predictions. This notebook helps identify systematic weaknesses in the model's predictions and generates actionable insights for improvement.

#### **Key Functions:**
- `analyze_errors(predictions, labels)`: Categorizes errors into different types (e.g., false positives, false negatives).
- `visualize_error_patterns(error_data)`: Generates visualizations to highlight common error patterns.

#### **Use Case:**
Useful for understanding the failure cases of an NLP model to improve its robustness.

### 2. **`1.Run_final_checklist_qa.ipynb`**
#### **Purpose:**
Implements a checklist-based quality assurance (QA) approach to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on predefined quality criteria.

#### **Key Functions:**
- `run_checklist_tests(model, test_cases)`: Runs a suite of predefined tests to validate model performance.
- `summarize_checklist_results(results)`: Aggregates test results into a concise report.

#### **Use Case:**
Ideal for validating the correctness and reliability of models before deployment.

### 3. **`2.Run_final_checklist_qa_augment.ipynb`**
#### **Purpose:**
Extends the checklist-based QA methodology by incorporating data augmentation. This ensures that the model can handle a wider range of input variations effectively.

#### **Key Functions:**
- `augment_data(data, augmentation_methods)`: Applies augmentation techniques like synonym replacement or noise injection.
- `evaluate_with_augmentation(model, augmented_data)`: Tests the model on augmented datasets.

#### **Use Case:**
Beneficial for testing models in real-world scenarios with noisy or augmented data.

---

### 4. **`3.Run_final_train_agument.ipynb`**
#### **Purpose:**
Handles the training process with augmented data. The goal is to improve the generalization capabilities of the model by training it on a more diverse dataset.

#### **Key Functions:**
- `train_model(model, data, epochs)`: Trains the model using augmented data over multiple epochs.
- `plot_training_metrics(metrics)`: Visualizes training progress (e.g., loss and accuracy trends).

#### **Use Case:**
Helpful for improving model robustness and accuracy in real-world applications.

---

### 5. **`4.Run_final_checklist_qa_runtest.ipynb`**
#### **Purpose:**
Conducts final testing of the trained model using the checklist-based QA methodology to ensure all quality criteria are met.

#### **Key Functions:**
- `test_model_with_checklist(model, test_data)`: Evaluates the trained model on QA tests.
- `generate_final_report(results)`: Summarizes final test results into a deploy-ready report.

#### **Use Case:**
Useful for final validation of the model before deployment to production.
